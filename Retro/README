Changes since last time:
	Added a second boss: Bird boss - shoots a bunch of armybirds.
	Boss now has scaling health as you progress further.
	Alternating bosses between moleboss and birdboss.
	Removed boost mechanic - it was not very useful and just made the game needlessly complicated.

	Setup for Android and iOS port
	Sucessfully ported to android. (Optimizations still required to make it run smoothly)
	Began manual garbage collection to reduce RAM usage at critical points
	Remove hero bullets if hero bullets go past 10 instances.
	Optimized images to be smaller and run better on android.
	Reduced resolution of space background to improve mobile performance
	Began implementation of advertisement module
	Cleaned up some leaking variables between each planet generation.
	Successfully prevent frequent Android crashes up to ~level 4
	APK file available at request. Email gqian1@jhu.edu if you want to test it.
	Slight rebalancing.
	Reduced amount of scenery to improve FPS on slower machines and mobile.
